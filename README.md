# Horizontal-cards-in-rows
Android Studio UI project on adding Horizontal Cards in Rows that are vertically aligned. 

I've been scrolling through the Internet on creating a grid like UI where Material design cards are used as a unit element and different units in different rows.
I was able to add Cards to the UI using a RecyclerView but was unable to add several recycler views in to separate rows.
This method was simple and easy. Instead of using a RecyclerView I added two LinearViews into ScrollViews and the Output looked like this!
